The purpose of the project activity is to utilize renewable wind energy for generation of electricity.
The project activity replaces anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG’s) into the
atmosphere, which is 2,36,080 tCO2e for this monitoring period, by displacing the equivalent
amount of electricity generation through the operation of existing fuel mix in the grid comprising
mainly fossil fuel-based power plants and future capacity expansions connected to the grid. In the
absence of the project activity the equivalent amount of electricity would have been generated from
the connected/ new power plants in the Indian grid, which are/ will be predominantly based on
fossil fuels. Whereas the electricity generation from the operation of Wind Energy Convertors
(WEC’s) is emission free.

The project activity consists of 86 WEGs of Enercon make E-48 and each machine capacity is of
800 kW (E-48) totaling to the capacity of 68.8 MW. The WEGs generates 3-phase power at 400V,
which is stepped up to 33 kV and connected to 33kV metering points. From 33 kV metering points
electricity transmitted to WWIL Sub-station. At sub-station electricity is step-up to 220 kV. From
WWIL substation electricity is further evacuated to the state electricity grid at 220kV. The Project
can operate in the frequency range of 47.5–51.5 Hz and in the voltage range of 400 V ± 12.5%. The
Power Purchase Agreement, signed on March 1st, 2006 in Bangalore, is between Bangalore
Electricity Supply Company Limited (BESCOM) and ENERCON WIND FARMS (Hindustan)
PRIVATE LIMITED for the sale and purchase of electricity generated by the project activity

The first machine under the project activity was commissioned on 29/09/2006 and the last machine
under the project activity was commissioned on 28/12/2006. Project activity WEGs were
commissioned in three phases between 29/09/2006 & 28/12/2006. 56 WEGs under phase-I were
commissioned on 29 Sep 2006, 9 WEGs under phase-II were commissioned on 26/10/2006 & 21
WEGs under phase-III were commissioned on 28/12/2006.

The time frame for this monitoring period is from 01/02/2022 to 31/12/2024. UCR Project ID or

PRIOR HISTORY
The project activity was registered under Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project with
registration number 1259, as well as Gold Standard (GS) with reference number 3664. The crediting
period of this project under CDM & GS is 27/10/2008 to 26/10/2018. PP seeks verification under
UCR from 27/10/2018 onwards, i.e., crediting period for UCR starts from 27/10/2018. Hence, there
is no double counting
